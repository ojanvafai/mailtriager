Before pointing others at it:
- Generate the setting spreadsheet instead of having people manually create it.
- Move the instruction text to make-time out of the spreadsheet.

P1: Will try to do soonish.
- Seem to have an off-by-one again in quick reply.
- updating the current thread seems to cut off a big chunk of the new message...but the quoted text is all there.
- Github issue emails are all from notifications@github.com instead of the person commenting
- Make quick reply default be 280.
- Typing q for quick reply puts a "q" in the quick reply field.
- Race condition with having a prerenderedThread, but not currentlyRendered. This probably happens when the current thread takes a long time to render but the next thread is fast. Instead, rework all the prerendering logic to have an atomic unit of a RenderableThread instead of separately tracking the currentThread/currentlyRendred, and prefetchedThread/prerendered. So currentThread poitns to a RenderableThread that has a render method that we can await...and actually it might make it easier ot render the thread in per message chunks.
- Make eliding keep well-formed markup.
- Test eliding with intereleaved html/plain-text emails
- List more names in the Vueue to see more of the dialog happening in the thread. Bold the names for more recent message.
- Show attachments
- Add "send+blocked" button for things where you want to make sure there is followup.
- Auto transition from Vueue to ThreadView if we are doing fetching and the Vueue is empty.
- "Re: Ping on get-originals?" thread is a good one for performance optimizing the diffing. Takes 2.5 seconds on my macbook pro! The rendering work is almost instant though once it's prerendered. Alternately, could render messages incrementally starting with the one right before the earliest unread one, then render all the remaining unread ones, then render the read ones. Regardless, wait until the diffing code is rewritten first.
- Make really resilient to flaky networks (e.g. queue up modify requests if they fail). This also can make sending emails something that happens instantly. Show pending work in the top-left so people can see what's pending and give a way of getting at the list of pending work.

P2: Will only do if something makes these seem worth doing.
- Fix stats to show count of archived threads
- Once the triage is done, allow picking which of the TL;DR, replying or tasking queues to work though. Obviously, replying and tasking require composition and tasks integration.
- When updating messages, update the unread state even for old messages since that might have changed.
- Update the list of threads based off what's in the inbox periodically (e.g. to include things that get unsnoozed).
- Add the ability to filter over arbitrary email headers (e.g. instead of allowing filtering over the sender header, allow sender:foo to filter over sender header, list-id:bar to filter over the list-id header, etc.
- sort by date
- Cache threads in localstorage by their historyId. Prefix with the week so we can clear any entries that are more than two weeks old.
- Add keyboard shortcuts for Vueue mode. j/k/x next/previous/toggle
- disable title tags in emails. They currently update the title of make-time.
- Provide a way to modify which spreadsheet is used as the settings sheet.
- add stats of how much time you spend in each phase and what aggregations of actions taken with threads
- Maybe have a generic list of filter buttons that can be configurable for quick experimentation with different labeling schemes. Keeps the principle of each thread gets a single keyborad shortcut action, but doesn't require the existing constrained set of labels. e.g. i find myself wanting to experiment with urgent/important options for action items and replies. Maybe this would all feel different if the action items actually went into the TODO list instead of the inbox though.
- add a needs filter option?
- add an urgent action item? what about important?
- Google Assistant integration
- Task tracker integration for the task button. To start with, the task button just puts it in the task tracker with no ability to customize.
- Don't use "prompt" for getting the spreadsheet URL.
- Send replys from the recieving address for multiple email users. Using "From: ". Not quite sure how to figure out which email address to use. For mailing lists, could use Delivered-To, that might be good enough.
- add a way of switching to a different queue in the thread at a time view
- add the ability to filter messages with no list-id as those are probably more urgent.
- if the last message is vacation responder, and the message before that one is read, and it's not in a triager/auto queue, then auto archive
- Add "-" or "!" for -foo@bar.com
- Have one filter field with to:, etc. and proper boolean logic with !, ||, &&. whitespace trimming, and quotes around strings
- Allow regexps with special regexp syntax, e.g. r'regexphere'.
