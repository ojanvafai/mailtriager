- Rework the code to not be spaghetti
- Make pretty
- Fix encoding issues (e.g. see any email with JS Blocks)
- don't return from fetchLabels until the first fetch that returns non-zero threads. Otherwise, we never render the first thread of the queue that does.
- elide repeated bits from messages
  poor man's quote finder: split email into N word chunks, make hashes, elide anything that's M or more contiguous chunks. The in followup work can walk forwards/backwards to find the actual boundary and to include the "on ... wrote:" text. Then further followup can try to do well-formed HTML. hash computation function https://cs.corp.google.com/piper///depot/google3/java/com/google/caribou/base/QuoteFinder.java?q=quotefinder&sq=package:piper+file://depot/google3+-file:google3/experimental&dr=CSs&l=332
- Get all the TRIAGER_LABEL and TO_TRIAGE_LABEL values out of the spreadsheet instead of hard coding
- Handle network failures gracefully, e.g. retry failures and/or show success/failure of requests in UI.
- add timer
- show week/month queues as a queue, not as individual messages, with the option to done/expand/track (if track, then it auto-dones at the end of the week/month)
- add stats of how much time you spend in each phase and what aggregations of actions taken with threads
- remove triager labels from auto/snoozed items
- make all ojru-mail tasks archive
- add ability to see the to addresses as well...maybe not by default though
- remove triager labels when mail is processed so it gets fully retriaged...or maybe show the current queue and let you decide whether to keep or change the queue?
- Need to make labeler not remove labels on things that have triager + auto labels, but no inbox.
- For daily/weekly/monthly queues, show just subject lines and let me select the ones I want to review more (with easy way to select all). The rest all get archived.
- add a favicon
- put scrolling on the outer page so wheel scrolling works anywhere on the page (e.g. in the body margin)

Maybe TODOs
- have a default max-width that's settable
- provide a way to sort labels other than alphabetical
- get high lighthouse score and add to homescreen
- automatically update to add new threads as they come in (right now requires reloading the page)
- Should readlater/task mark the messages as read?
- Task tracker integration for the task button. To start with, the task button just puts it in the task tracker with no ability to customize.
- Figure out a way to make block snooze. Might involve implementing our own snooze functionality entirely, but then that means we can't use snooze or rely on in the gmail UI?
- add a concept of the quick triage first, then the process triage where you get more time per message
- Add option to expand out the read items
- add options to show labels on each message (useful for debugging)
- preload the next N threads instead of just the next one
- Use a sandboxed iframe for the HTML contents so innerHTML can be done without fear.
