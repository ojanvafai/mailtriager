Empty inbox + unprocessed mail means you get sent to triaged view instead of waiting for mail to process. Really triaged and maketime views need to give you an indication of there being threads that need triaging.

In make-time mode:
- NeedsReply automatically opens a quick reply box, gives it a longer allowed length
- Starts a stopwatch timer to count how long it take you to accomplish this task.
- Store task durations for future data analysis

P1: Will try to do soonish.
- Kinda want all the triage and prioritization actions available in both triaged and make-time. Maybe add a retriage button that pulls back in all the triaging buttons?
- Add ability to transition into any triage mode at any point
- Archiving should remove priorities, should all triage actions?
- s/Done/Archive. The difficulty is that the keyboard shortcut now conflicts with Action Item
- Show which triage phase youre in that the top and structure the help to show the outline/workflow of phases more clearly
- Add the auto-highlight-next behavior of Triaged to ViewAll as well.
- Add a sorted TODO list view of each of the triage queues. Highlight each item and force you to pick must do (i.e. can't go home until it's done), important&urgent, !important&urgent, important&!urgent, done.
- Only show toolbar in any of the views when there are actually threads.
- Find a way to separate out tasks that can be done on a phone so they can be fit into 5 minute breaks
- Make really resilient to flaky networks (e.g. queue up modify requests if they fail). This also can make sending emails something that happens instantly. Show pending work in the top-left so people can see what's pending and give a way of getting at the list of pending work. Ping google.com or something to see if offline since navigator.online doesn't catch flaky networks.
- Update the list of threads based off what's in the inbox periodically (e.g. to include things that get unsnoozed).
- Grey out undo button when there's nothing to undo
- race condition: if the user hits undo before the triage action is done, it will undo the previous triage action
- grey out filter rows and queues when they are deleted instead of immediately removing them and add an undo button in case the delete button was hit by accident.
- Use TypeScript and create an abstract View superclass and an abstract Dialog superclass.
- Add the ability to create new action items that have no existing thread
- Think generally about navigation through phases. Actually update the url for each phase so people can link to the phase they want? But then reload would put them back in that phase.

P2: Will only do if something makes these seem worth doing.
- Allow sorting the threads within a priority bucket.
- auto go into make time when having triaged all the items
- Generalize tha ability to skip any of the modes. Curreently can only skip ViewAll.
- Lazy load things like views/Settings.js and ViewOne.js. I guess this depends on switching to modules.
- add undo to ViewAll and Triaged
- Fix eliding to group better
- Add autocomplete for label names in the queues and filters views.
- Removing a queue means the currently queued messages never get dequeued
- Have timer dialog have options to cancel timer and turnoff autostart.
- Have filter UI do gmail search to show which things match?
- Add to home screen support
- Support renaming labels (updates the label name in all the filters and queues).
- Add "||" to rule query language.
- Add "-" or "!" for -foo@bar.com
- Allow regexps with special regexp syntax, e.g. r'regexphere'.
- Move queued_label fetching into the Settings class to consolidate all the spreadsheet settings fetching there.
- Save back in the current format, but upgrade to the new format using the number of columns as the effective version number
- group filter rules with the same label like headers in asana. For a given grouping of rules, sort the rules alphabetically
- autocomplete the allowed filter fields in the rule editor
- add drag and drop reordering of filters
- Include "XXX wrote" prefixes in quote eliding
- elide quotes based off the "In-Reply-To" instead of whatever happens to be the previous message
- Add "send+blocked" button for things where you want to make sure there is followup.
- List more names in the Vueue to see more of the dialog happening in the thread. Bold the names for more recent message.
- Render messages in reverse order and return from render() when all the unread messages + 1 read message have been rendered (min 2 messages if all are unread). Then render the rest of the read messages async.
- Make monthly queues easier. Maybe allow picking which day monthly queues are dequeued, or maybe better, allow skipping dequeueing them for N days at a time and have the "month" be a month after the last time you dequeued. That way, you can dequeue on a day when you know you have the time for it.
- Give a way to show the email headers so that people can easily write filters based off the headers.
- Have key handling code early return if a dialog is open.
- updating the current thread seems to cut off a big chunk of the new message...but the quoted text is all there. Hard to reproduce. :(
- "Re: Ping on get-originals?" thread is a good one for performance overhead of message processing. Half the time is base64 decoding and half is eliding quotes. Takes 1 second doing message processing, but rendering is very fast. Could render messages incrementally starting with the one right before the earliest unread one, then render all the remaining unread ones, then render the read ones. Mostly this is hidden by prefetching.
- Put links for downloading attachments.
- Show attachment blobs for gsuite docs like gmail does.
- Fix stats to show count of archived threads
- Once the triage is done, allow picking which of the TL;DR, replying or tasking queues to work though. Obviously, replying and tasking require composition and tasks integration.
- When updating messages, update the unread state even for old messages since that might have changed.
- sort by date withing a given queue, with a setting for sort order
- Cache threads in localstorage by their historyId. Prefix with the week so we can clear any entries that are more than two weeks old.
- Add keyboard shortcuts for Vueue mode. j/k/x next/previous/toggle
- disable title tags in emails. They currently update the title of make-time.
- add stats of how much time you spend in each phase and what aggregations of actions taken with threads
- Maybe have a generic list of filter buttons that can be configurable for quick experimentation with different labeling schemes. Keeps the principle of each thread gets a single keyborad shortcut action, but doesn't require the existing constrained set of labels. e.g. i find myself wanting to experiment with urgent/important options for action items and replies. Maybe this would all feel different if the action items actually went into the TODO list instead of the inbox though.
- add a needs filter option?
- add an urgent action item? what about important?
- Google Assistant integration
- Task tracker integration for the task button. To start with, the task button just puts it in the task tracker with no ability to customize.
- Send replys from the recieving address for multiple email users. Using "From: ". Not quite sure how to figure out which email address to use. For mailing lists, could use Delivered-To, that might be good enough.
- add a way of switching to a different queue in the thread at a time view
- if the last message is vacation responder, and the message before that one is read, and it's not in a triager/auto queue, then auto archive
