TODOs for filters:
- Add ability to require a filter rule to apply to all messages in the thread.
- add the ability to filter messages with no list-id as those are probably more urgent.
- If something is already in the inbox, don't daily/weekly/monthly queue it, just apply the label as needstriage directly, otherwise it will get delayed fruther before you see it.
- add back in the ability to put something in the inbox with no label since the triager now treats that as most urgent
- if the last message is vacation responder, and the message before that one is read, and it's not in a triager/auto queue, then auto archive
- Add "-" or "!" for -foo@bar.com
- Have one filter field with to:, etc. and proper boolean logic with !, ||, &&. whitespace trimming, and quotes around strings
- Allow regexps with special regexp syntax, e.g. r'regexphere'.
- Make logs save to Drive for retroactive debugging.

P0
- show To field
- show the date/time of messages
- Maybe have a generic list of filter buttons that can be configurable for quick experimentation with different labeling schemes. Keeps the principle of each thread gets a single keyborad shortcut action, but doesn't require the existing constrained set of labels. e.g. i find myself wanting to experiment with urgent/important options for action items and replies. Maybe this would all feel different if the action items actually went into the TODO list instead of the inbox though.
- add a needs filter option?
- add an urgent action item? what about important?
- Don't elide inside style tags and need to make sure that eliding respects markup.
- Make blocked show items once a week. Not quite sure how to implement this while keeping it decoupled from the spreadsheet logic. If the dequeue supports dequeueing just based off the label name, then ojrumail can rely on it to dequeue without tight integration just for blocked items...blocked items just go into queued/Tuesday/blocked or something like that. But it still requires you to use the spreadsheet if you want blocked to do anything other than put a label on it.
- super mute. Not quite sure how to implement this. If in the spreadsheet apps script, could walk the history of the thread to see if any of the messages are supermuted? That tightly couples the apps script and ojru-mail though.
- Fix race condition where if new message comes in after ojru has prefetched, the archiving will archive that as well.
- show week/month queues as a list, not as individual messages, with the option to done/expand/track (if track, then it auto-dones at the end of the week/month)

P1
- Log performance of showing next thread after an action was taken so we can see if we need to improve it. One of these services should make it pretty easy.
- add timer
- add stats of how much time you spend in each phase and what aggregations of actions taken with threads
- allow tweet length replies
- Handle network failures gracefully, e.g. retry failures and/or show success/failure of requests in UI.
- use virtual scroller!
- get high lighthouse score and add to homescreen
- automatically update to add new threads as they come in (right now requires reloading the page)
- add options to show labels on each message (useful for debugging)
- preload the next N threads instead of just the next one
- Undo previous action
- Google Assistant integration
- Once the triage is done, allow for pick which of the TL;DR, replying or tasking queues to work though. Obviously, replying and tasking require composition and tasks integration.
- Task tracker integration for the task button. To start with, the task button just puts it in the task tracker with no ability to customize.
- Feature request for once we have a reply mode: by default send "dones", but also add send & blocked for things where you want to make sure there is followup.
