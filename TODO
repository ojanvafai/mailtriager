- show To field
- show the date/time of messages
- Don't elide inside style tags and need to make sure that eliding respects markup.

- Make blocked show items once a week. Not quite sure how to implement this while keeping it decoupled from the spreadsheet logic. If the dequeue supports dequeueing just based off the label name, then ojrumail can rely on it to dequeue without tight integration just for blocked items...blocked items just go into queued/Tuesday/blocked or something like that. But it still requires you to use the spreadsheet if you want blocked to do anything other than put a label on it.
- super mute. Not quite sure how to implement this. If in the spreadsheet apps script, could walk the history of the thread to see if any of the messages are supermuted? That tightly couples the apps script and ojru-mail though.
- Fix race condition where if new message comes in after ojru has prefetched, the archiving will archive that as well.
- show week/month queues as a queue, not as individual messages, with the option to done/expand/track (if track, then it auto-dones at the end of the week/month)

P1
- Log performance of showing next thread after an action was taken so we can see if we need to improve it. One of these services should make it pretty easy.
- add timer
- add stats of how much time you spend in each phase and what aggregations of actions taken with threads
- allow tweet length replies
- Handle network failures gracefully, e.g. retry failures and/or show success/failure of requests in UI.
- use virtual scroller!
- get high lighthouse score and add to homescreen
- automatically update to add new threads as they come in (right now requires reloading the page)
- add options to show labels on each message (useful for debugging)
- preload the next N threads instead of just the next one
- Undo previous action
- Google Assistant integration
- Once the triage is done, allow for pick which of the TL;DR, replying or tasking queues to work though. Obviously, replying and tasking require composition and tasks integration.
- Task tracker integration for the task button. To start with, the task button just puts it in the task tracker with no ability to customize.
- Feature request for once we have a reply mode: by default send "dones", but also add send & blocked for things where you want to make sure there is followup.
