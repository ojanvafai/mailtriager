- Get all the config values out of the spreadsheet instead of hard coding
- Show some UI to show success/failure of requests.
- Retry failures
- Rework the code to not be spaghetti
- Make pretty
- Don't show per message labels, just what label you're currently triaging.
- taking an action takes it out of the triage queue
- done/reply/blocked/mute should mark all the messages as read. process proably shouldn't. What about task?
- get high lighthouse score and add to homescreen
- add timer
- Sort by label
- show week/month queues as a queue, not as individual messages, with the option to done/expand/track (if track, then it auto-dones at the end of the week/month)
- add stats of how much time you spend in each phase and what aggregations of actions taken with threads

Maybe TODOs
- Task tracker integration for the task button. To start with, the task button just puts it in the task tracker with no ability to customize.
- Figure out a way to make block snooze. Might involve implementing our own snooze functionality entirely, but then that means we can't use snooze or rely on in the gmail UI?
- add a concept of the quick triage first, then the process triage where you get more time per message
- Add option to expand out the read items
- add options to show labels on each message (useful for debugging)
- preload the next N threads instead of just the next one
- Use a sandboxed iframe for the HTML contents so innerHTML can be done without fear.
