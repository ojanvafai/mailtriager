P1: Will try to do soonish.
- Don't elide inside style tags and need to make sure that eliding respects markup.
- Show attachments
- List more names in the Vueue to see more of the dialog happening in the thread. Bold the names for more recent message.

P2: Will only do if something makes these seem worth doing.
- When updating messages, update the unread state even for old messages since that might have changed.
- Update the list of threads based off what's in the inbox periodically (e.g. to include things that get unsnoozed).
- Add the ability to filter over arbitrary email headers (e.g. instead of allowing filtering over the sender header, allow sender:foo to filter over sender header, list-id:bar to filter over the list-id header, etc.
- sort by date
- handle going offline gracefully. Pause network activity and wait for coming back online.
- Cache threads in localstorage by their historyId. Prefix with the week so we can clear any entries that are more than two weeks old.
- Add keyboard shortcuts for Vueue mode. j/k/x next/previous/toggle
- disable title tags in emails. They currently update the title of make-time.
- Provide a way to modify which spreadsheet is used as the settings sheet.
- Log performance of showing next thread after an action was taken so we can see if we need to improve it. One of these services should make it pretty easy.
- add stats of how much time you spend in each phase and what aggregations of actions taken with threads
- Maybe have a generic list of filter buttons that can be configurable for quick experimentation with different labeling schemes. Keeps the principle of each thread gets a single keyborad shortcut action, but doesn't require the existing constrained set of labels. e.g. i find myself wanting to experiment with urgent/important options for action items and replies. Maybe this would all feel different if the action items actually went into the TODO list instead of the inbox though.
- add a needs filter option?
- add an urgent action item? what about important?
- Google Assistant integration
- Once the triage is done, allow picking which of the TL;DR, replying or tasking queues to work though. Obviously, replying and tasking require composition and tasks integration.
- Task tracker integration for the task button. To start with, the task button just puts it in the task tracker with no ability to customize.
- Feature request for once we have a reply mode: by default send "dones", but also add send & blocked for things where you want to make sure there is followup.
- Don't use "prompt" for getting the spreadsheet URL.
- Send replys from the recieving address for multiple email users. Using "From: ". Not quite sure how to figure out which email address to use. For mailing lists, could use Delivered-To, that might be good enough.
- add a way of switching to a different queue in the thread at a time view

TODOs for filters:
- add the ability to filter messages with no list-id as those are probably more urgent.
- add the ability to put something in the inbox with no label since the triager now treats that as most urgent
- if the last message is vacation responder, and the message before that one is read, and it's not in a triager/auto queue, then auto archive
- Add "-" or "!" for -foo@bar.com
- Have one filter field with to:, etc. and proper boolean logic with !, ||, &&. whitespace trimming, and quotes around strings
- Allow regexps with special regexp syntax, e.g. r'regexphere'.
