- Get all the config values out of the spreadsheet instead of hard coding
- Rework the code to not be spaghetti
- Make pretty
- Don't show per message labels, just what label you're currently triaging.
- Make read items expandable
- add reply, blocked, mute, task shortcuts
- done/reply/blocked/mute should mark all the messages as read. process proably shouldn't. What about task?
- remove the ability to navigate threads with j/k
- get high lighthouse score and add to homescreen
- add timer
- Sort by label
- show week/month queues as a queue, not as individual messages, with the option to done/expand/track (if track, then it auto-dones at the end of the week/month)
- add a concept of the quick triage first, then the process triage where you get more time per message
- add stats of how much time you spend in each phase and what aggregations of actions taken with threads
- reply takes it out of the triage queue
- Block snoozes and removes any autolabels. Needs a UI for picking date/time.
- To start with, the task button just puts it in the task tracker with no ability to customize.

Maybe TODOs
- Add option to expand out the read items
- add options to show labels on each message (useful for debugging)
- preload the next N threads instead of just the next one
- Use a sandboxed iframe for the HTML contents so innerHTML can be done without fear.
