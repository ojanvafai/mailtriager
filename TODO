P1: Will try to do soonish.
- Have key handling code early return if a dialog is open.
- Make filter settings UI as a precursor to having task tracking.
- Show the triage queues in the Vueue when there is nothing to triage.
- Consider changing all the labels to be make-time prefixed? Then can be sure that only make-time labels are touched aside from archiving things.
- Create a Spreadsheet class or a spreadsheet utils container to put the spreadsheet methods into.
- Make really resilient to flaky networks (e.g. queue up modify requests if they fail). This also can make sending emails something that happens instantly. Show pending work in the top-left so people can see what's pending and give a way of getting at the list of pending work.
- Don't have undo do anything if there's nothing to undo.

P2: Will only do if something makes these seem worth doing.
- Include "XXX wrote" prefixes in quote eliding
- elide quotes based off the "In-Reply-To" instead of whatever happens to be the previous message
- Add "send+blocked" button for things where you want to make sure there is followup.
- List more names in the Vueue to see more of the dialog happening in the thread. Bold the names for more recent message.
- Render messages in reverse order and return from render() when all the unread messages + 1 read message have been rendered (min 2 messages if all are unread). Then render the rest of the read messages async.
- Move queued labels to the settings dialog and make it so you can pick which day monthly queues are dequeued.
- Give a way to show the email headers so that people can easily write filters based off the headers.
- updating the current thread seems to cut off a big chunk of the new message...but the quoted text is all there. Hard to reproduce. :(
- "Re: Ping on get-originals?" thread is a good one for performance overhead of message processing. Half the time is base64 decoding and half is eliding quotes. Takes 1 second doing message processing, but rendering is very fast. Could render messages incrementally starting with the one right before the earliest unread one, then render all the remaining unread ones, then render the read ones. Mostly this is hidden by prefetching.
- Put links for downloading attachments.
- Show attachment blobs for gsuite docs like gmail does.
- Fix stats to show count of archived threads
- Once the triage is done, allow picking which of the TL;DR, replying or tasking queues to work though. Obviously, replying and tasking require composition and tasks integration.
- When updating messages, update the unread state even for old messages since that might have changed.
- Update the list of threads based off what's in the inbox periodically (e.g. to include things that get unsnoozed).
- sort by date withing a given queue, with a setting for sort order
- Cache threads in localstorage by their historyId. Prefix with the week so we can clear any entries that are more than two weeks old.
- Add keyboard shortcuts for Vueue mode. j/k/x next/previous/toggle
- disable title tags in emails. They currently update the title of make-time.
- Provide a way to modify which spreadsheet is used as the settings sheet.
- add stats of how much time you spend in each phase and what aggregations of actions taken with threads
- Maybe have a generic list of filter buttons that can be configurable for quick experimentation with different labeling schemes. Keeps the principle of each thread gets a single keyborad shortcut action, but doesn't require the existing constrained set of labels. e.g. i find myself wanting to experiment with urgent/important options for action items and replies. Maybe this would all feel different if the action items actually went into the TODO list instead of the inbox though.
- add a needs filter option?
- add an urgent action item? what about important?
- Google Assistant integration
- Task tracker integration for the task button. To start with, the task button just puts it in the task tracker with no ability to customize.
- Send replys from the recieving address for multiple email users. Using "From: ". Not quite sure how to figure out which email address to use. For mailing lists, could use Delivered-To, that might be good enough.
- add a way of switching to a different queue in the thread at a time view
- add the ability to filter messages with no list-id as those are probably more urgent.
- if the last message is vacation responder, and the message before that one is read, and it's not in a triager/auto queue, then auto archive
- Add "-" or "!" for -foo@bar.com
- Have one filter field with to:, etc. and proper boolean logic with !, ||, &&. whitespace trimming, and quotes around strings
- Allow regexps with special regexp syntax, e.g. r'regexphere'.
